					Every Coin has two sides and in same way marriage is one side and divorce is the opposite side of Coin. Divorce means separation of husband and wife from a legally solemnized marriage in a legally and customarily prescribed way by which both acquires a right to remarry again legal. 
					<br>India has different divorce laws for different religions. Almost all the religions have their own divorce laws in India which are used amongst themselves. There are separate laws for inter-caste or inter-religion marriages. Divorce laws in India for Hindus are described in Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Hindu Marriage Act is also used for Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains as they don't have their own separate marriage and divorce laws. Here is the list of various divorce laws in India for various religions:<br>A marriage certificate is an important proof, in case there are some problems between you and your spouse in the future and a legal action needs to be taken.<br>
					<b>LIST OF VARIOUS DIVORCE LAWS IN INDIA FOR VARIOUS RELIGIONS:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 : Hindus as well as Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains can seek divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act 1955.
						</li><li>Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 .

						</li><li>A cursory reading of the entire gamut of Indian Laws regarding Divorce makes it clear broadly that the Divorce can be obtained by two ways:
						</li><li>Divorce by Mutual Consent
						</li><li>Contested Divorce 
						</li></ul>
						<br>
						<b>CONTESTED DIVORCE:</b><br>
						In such cases either of the spouses can file a petition for the dissolution of marriage amongst the grounds available to him/her under the law applicable to them and the petitioner (one who files the petition/case) has to prove his case. On successfully proving the charges and grounds, divorce decree is granted by the Court. 
						<br><b>MUTUAL CONSENT DIVORCE:</b><br>
						In Mutual consent Divorce, a joint Divorce petition is filed in the District Court containing all terms and conditions regarding settlement between Husband and wife. Statement is recorded by the Court. Subsequently, Court calls parties again after six months to get their statement recorded. After recording of statement, Court grants Decree of Divorce and by virtue of same marriage gets dissolved. 
						<br><b>ANNULMENT OF MARRIAGE:</b><br>
						Marriage in India can also be dissolved by means of Annulment. Procedure for annulment is same as that of Divorce except that the grounds for annulment are different than that of divorce. Grounds for annulment are fraud, pregnancy of wife by person other than the husband, impotency prior to the marriage and subsist even at the time of filing the case. 
						Once annulment is granted by the Indian Court, status of the parties remains as it was prior to the marriage.
						<br><b>VOID MARRIAGE:</b><br>
						There are certain form of marriages which are null and void despite the performance /solemnization of the same. Marriage is void under following circumstances:-
						<ul><li>neither party has a spouse living at the time of the marriage 
						</li><li>the parties are not within the degrees of prohibited relationship, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two; 
						</li><li>the parties are not spends of each other, unless the custom or usage governing each of them permits of a marriage between the two.
						</li><li>Time duration for obtaining divorce varies from case to case & place to place. Generally speaking, contested divorce proceedings take approximately 18 to 24 months. Mutual Consent Divorce varies from 4 weeks to 7 months and more. In Delhi, Mutual Consent Divorce is possible within two to four weeks.
